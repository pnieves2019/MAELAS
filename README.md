-------------------------
WHAT IS MAELAS CODE?
-------------------------

MAELAS code is a software to calculate spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients and magnetoelastic constants up to second order. It generates required input files for VASP code to perform Density Functional Theory calculations, and it deduces the value of magnetostriction coefficients from the calculated energies given by VASP. If the elastic tensor is provided, then it can also calculate the magnetoelastic constants.

MAELAS can also be used with other DFT codes instead of VASP, after file conversion to VASP format files.


------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------

MAELAS code is just one python3 file "maelas.py", so it only requires to have Python3 and imported python libraries. For example, in Ubuntu Linux machine you can check the installed version of python3 by opening a terminal and typing

python3 --version

In case you need to install it in your machine, you can type

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3.8

In HPC facilities you may need to load the Python3 module. For example, in Centos 7 Linux you can check all installed Python modules by typing

ml avail Python

and load the last version of Python3 using command ml

ml Python/3.8.2-GCC-8.3.0-2.32-base

Additionally, MAELAS makes use of the following python libraries: pymatgen, scikit-learn, pyfiglet, argparse, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, math, os and stat. In case you need to install them, you can do it using pip3 as:

pip3 install pymatgen

pip3 install scikit-learn

pip3 install pyfiglet

pip3 install argparse

pip3 install numpy

pip3 install matplotlib

pip3 install scipy

pip3 install math

pip3 install os

pip3 install stat

In case you need to install pip3 in Ubuntu Linux

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3-pip


----------------------------------
HOW TO USE MAELAS CODE
----------------------------------

Running MAELAS code consists in the following four steps.


--------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Cell relaxation
--------------------------------------------------------

If your initial POSCAR is not relaxed and you want to perform a cell relaxation before calculating the magentostriction coefficients, then you can use MAELAS code to generate INCAR and KPOINTS files to relax the structure with VASP. To do so, in the terminal you should copy your initial POSCAR and maelas.py files in the same folder where you want to generate the input files for VASP, and after going to this folder then type

python3 maelas.py -r -i POSCAR0 -k 40

where tag -r indicates that you want to generate VASP files for cell relaxation, -i POSCAR0 is the input non-relaxed POSCAR file (you can name it whatever you want) and -k 40 is the length parameter that determines a regular mesh of k-points. It will generate 4 files: POSCAR, INCAR, KPOINTS and vasp_jsub_rlx. Here, one still needs to copy manually the POTCAR file in this folder in order to have all required files for VASP run. The generated file vasp_jsub_rlx is a script to submit jobs in HPC facilities, one can specify some settings in this script by adding more tags in the command line. For instance,

python3 maelas.py -r -i POSCAR0 -k 40 -t 48 -c 24 -q qprod -a OPEN-00-00 -f /scratch/example_rlx

where -t 48 indicates that the number of maximum CPU hours for the VASP calculation is 48 hours, -c 24 means that the number of cores for the VASP calculation is 24, -q qprod set to production queue the type of queue in HPC facilities, -a OPEN-00-00 is the project identification number for running jobs in HPC facilities and -f /scratch/example_rlx is the folder where you want to run VASP calculations. All these data are included in the vasp_jsub_rlx file, so one can submit this VASP job inmediately in HPC facilities by typing

qsub vasp_jsub_rlx

This procedure might be helpful for high-throughput routines. More options can be added in vasp_jsub_rlx file through the terminal command line, to see them just type

python3 maelas.py -h

Note that generated INCAR and KPOINTS files contain standard setting for cell relaxation. The user is free to change this setting either directly on the generated files or in the maelas.py.

In case your structure is already relaxed or you do not want to perform a cell relaxation, then you can skip this step and move to step 2.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Generation of VASP files for the calculation of spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy the relaxed POSCAR, POTCAR and maelas.py files in the same folder where you want to generate the input files for VASP run. In the terminal, after going to this folder then type

python3 maelas.py -g -i POSCAR_rlx -k 70 -n 7 -s 0.01

where -g indicates that you want to generate input VASP files for the calculation of spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients, -i POSCAR_rlx is the initial relaxed POSCAR file (you can name it whatever you want), -k 40 is the length parameter that determines a regular mesh of k-points, -n 7 means that it will generate 7 distorted states for each magentostriction mode and -s 0.01 is the maximum strain applied for distorting the structure. It will generate the following files:


POSCAR_A_B (volume-conserving distorted cell where A=magnetostriction mode, B=1,...,n distorted cell for each magentostriction mode)

INCAR_A_C (non-collinear calculation where A=magnetostriction mode, C=1,2 is the spin orientation case)

INCAR_std (collinear calculation to generate the WAVECAR and CHGCAR files to run non-collinear calculations)

KPOINTS

vasp_maelas, vasp_jsub and vasp_0 (interconnected bash scripts to run VASP calculations automatically)

vasp_cp_oszicar (bash script to get calculated OSZICAR_A_B_C files after VASP calculation finish)


The generated files vasp_maelas, vasp_jsub and vasp_0 are interconnected scripts to submit jobs in HPC facilities, one can specify some job settings in these scripts by adding more tags in the command line. For instance,

python3 maelas.py -g -i POSCAR_rlx -k 70 -n 7 -s 0.1 -t 48 -c 24 -q qprod -a OPEN-00-00 -f /scratch/example_mag

where -t 48 indicates that the number of maximum CPU hours for the VASP calculation is 48 hours, -c 24 means that the number of cores for the VASP calculation is 24, -q qprod set to production queue the type of queue in HPC facilities, -a OPEN-00-00 is the project identification number for running jobs in HPC facilities and -f /scratch/example_mag is the folder where you want to run VASP calculations.This procedure might be helpful for high-throughput routines. More options can be added in these script files through the terminal command line, to see them just type

python3 maelas.py -h

Note that generated INCAR_std, INCAR_A_C and KPOINTS files contain standard setting for collinear and non-collinear calculations. The user is free to change this setting either directly on the generated files or in the maelas.py.


-----------------------------
Step 3: Run VASP calculations
-----------------------------

For each generated POSCAR_A_B one should run first a collinear calculation using INCAR_std and use the generated WAVECAR and CHGCAR files to run non-collinear calculations for each INCAR_A_C (C=1,2) using the same POSCAR_A_B. This procedure can be automatically done in HPC facilities just by running the generated bash script

./vasp_maelas

This will launch independent jobs for each POSCAR_A_B. Each job will run 3 VASP calculations: a collinear one to generate WAVECAR and CHGCAR files, and two non-collinear for INCAR_A_1 and INCAR_A_2. The jobs will be executed in subfolders P_A_B inside the folder indicated by tag -f in the step 2.

Once all jobs are finished, then one can easily get calculated non-collinear OSZICAR files (needed in step 4), by running the bash script

./vasp_cp_oszicar

it will copy these OSZICAR files and name them as OSZICAR_A_B_C (C=1,2) in the same folder where this script is executed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Derivation of spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients from the energy written in the OSZICAR files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, to derive the spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients one needs to have in the same folder the following files:
    

maelas.py

POSCAR_rlx (the relaxed POSCAR file used as input in step 2)

POSCAR_A_B (distorted POSCAR generated in step 2)

OSZICAR_A_B_C (non-collinear OSZICAR files calculated in step 3 for each POSCAR_A_B and INCAR_A_C)


Next, in the terminal go to this folder a type

python3 maelas.py -d -i POSCAR_rlx -n 7

where -d indicates that you want to derive the spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients from the calculated OSZICAR files, -i POSCAR_rlx is the relaxed POSCAR file used as input in step 2 (you can name it whatever you want) and -n 7 is the number of distorted states for each magentostriction mode used in step 2.

It will derive and print the calculated spin-dependent magnetostriction coefficients in the terminal. If you want to print it in a file (for example, "results.out"), then you can type

python3 maelas.py -d -i POSCAR_rlx -n 7 > results.out

Additionally, the energy values extracted from OSZICAR_A_B_C files are shown in generated files ene_A_C.dat and fit_ene_A_C.png. The energy difference between the two spin configurations for each magnetostriction mode are shown in Fig. dE_A.png.

If the elastic tensor is provided as input, then MAELAS can calculate the magnetoelastic constants. To do so, one needs to add tags -b and -e with the name of the file containing the elastic tensor with the same format and units (GPa) as it is written by AELAS code (file ELADAT). You can check this format in the Examples folder. Hence, you could type

python3 maelas.py -d -i POSCAR_rlx -n 7 -b -e ELADAT

where ELADAT is the name of the file (it could be whatever name you want) with the elastic tensor data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using MAELAS with other DFT codes instead of VASP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAELAS has been designed to read and write files for VASP code automatically. However, it is possible to use MAELAS with other DFT codes instead of VASP, after file conversion to VASP format files. Although, this process might require some extra work for the user. Namely, converting initial and distorted POSCAR files into the other DFT code format, reading the spin direction of each state from INCAR_A_C files (variable SAXIS) and write the calculated energies in a OSZICAR-like file (called OSZICAR_A_B_C) on the penultimate line and third column with same format as in VASP (this is the place where MAELAS reads the energy value of each OSZICAR_A_B_C file). See the Manual for more details. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystal systems supported by MAELAS v1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current version supports the following crystal systems:

Cubic (I) (space groups 207-230)

Cubic (II) (space groups 195-206)

Hexagonal (I) (space groups 177-194)

Hexagonal (II) point group 6/m (space groups 175-176)

Trigonal (I) (space groups 149-167)

Tetragonal (I) (space groups 89-142)

Orthorhombic (space groups 16-74)


In the future, if the theoretical expressions of magnetostriction are derived for the remain crystal systems, then we will try to implement them in the new versions of the code.
